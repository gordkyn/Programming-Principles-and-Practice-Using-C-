# Programming Principles and Practice Using C++

Answers to exercises in 1st edition book using C++ (duh)

Personal opinion: I have first edition of this book and currently there is a 2nd edition, which is updated according to CPP11. A lot of people on the internet claim its best to start learning with at least CPP11, therefore implying 1st edition is obsolete. I strongly disagree with this opinion as the CPP11 improvements are not relevant enough for a beginner.
